# Terrorist-Detection-OpenCV
Facial recognition project in C++ with the OpenCV library for the detection of terrorists in surveillance cameras in real time.


The reason for this work is to apply computer vision techniques to achieve a reliable terrorist detection system, in the sense of the number of recognition mistakes it makes and which is also fast enough to be able to be executed. in a security camera in real time.

This type of system is enormously complex and in which the first problem that is presented to us is not that of recognition itself, but that of detecting the faces on the image. Once the faces are detected, they pass to the facial recognition system, in which we must identify those faces, which presents numerous challenges. Among some of these challenges we have to face the variation of light, not only because of the amount of light, but it can also come from different directions. In addition, faces can present different perspectives, be turned, with different facial expressions, and to make matters worse, the face also changes due to aging. All this makes implementing a recognition system that has a high degree of precision extremely difficult, since the factors to be taken into account are very high.
